Click on the buttons to display the cartoon. Hover over the cartoon to see the text. When you have read the first six, the seventh habit will become visible.

There was a reset button, but there are too many bugs, so when you have finished, click the good old refresh page button to start again. You could always fix the bugs if you want.

As a simple learning tool, the Learn Cube works well enough. Its main flaw is that it can only really display six sides. The 7th is a bit forced. Saying that, it has given me ideas for something new. Something that has a better story flow. Anyhow, that's me done on it for now.
